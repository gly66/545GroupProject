# Brief description on how the design is relevant to the target demographic
Our target customers are extended families and co-tenants. Fridge Partner offers fridge management, food management, and other features. Each person can create their account, create their fridge, and invite other members to join. Within each fridge group, each member can add, delete, and modify food, and each action is logged. Therefore, the Fridge Partner can help to separate the food of different people in the group, so as to effectively manage the food in the refrigerator. Our Fridge Partner also provides expiration reminders to remind users to consume or dispose of food as soon as possible to minimize food waste. In addition to this, Fridge Partner also provides recipe suggestions to help users consume the ingredients in the fridge.

# Design value
In America, food waste is a significant issue, with about 40% of food produced going uneaten (EPA). Americans throw away 103 pounds of spoiled food from their fridge every year. This waste occurs at all stages—from farms and retail to households—costing billions and harming the environment through wasted resources and increased greenhouse gas emissions from decomposing organic matter. Our Fridge Partner aims to improve this waste through effective fridge management.

# Success criteria
To effectively measure the success of our Fridge Partner app, focus on key metrics such as user engagement, which includes tracking the number of active users and their frequency of app usage. Assess the reduction in food waste by analyzing user-reported data on expired items, and gauge long-term waste reduction trends. User satisfaction should be evaluated through feedback surveys and app store ratings to understand user experiences and areas for improvement. Additionally, monitor financial performance through revenue from advertisements and donations, and keep an eye on operational metrics like user retention rates and customer support queries. Regularly reviewing these metrics will help optimize the app’s impact and user satisfaction.
