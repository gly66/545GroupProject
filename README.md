## Project Analysis  
### Value Proposition  
In America, food waste is a significant issue, with about 40% of food produced going uneaten (EPA). Americans throw away 103 pounds of spoiled food from their fridge every year[1]. This waste occurs at all stages—from farms and retail to households—costing billions and harming the environment through wasted resources and increased greenhouse gas emissions from decomposing organic matter. Our Fridge Assistant aims to improve this waste through effective fridge management.  

### Primary Purpose  
Our applications are designed to help users meticulously track the contents of their refrigerators and the shelf life of each item, enabling them to minimize waste and reduce living costs. By providing tools to monitor food inventory accurately, our apps empower individuals to make informed decisions about food usage before it spoils. This not only helps households save money but also contributes to broader societal benefits. Reducing food waste is crucial for maximizing resource efficiency and minimizing the environmental impact, particularly in terms of decreasing greenhouse gas emissions that result from the decomposition of wasted food in landfills. These efforts collectively foster a more sustainable planet.  

### Target Audience  
Families with Specific Characteristics:  
Large Families: Households with multiple children or extended family members living together tend to have higher food consumption and waste. Targeting these families could address significant food management challenges.  
Suburban Families: These families often have more storage space, leading to overbuying and increased food spoilage. Tailoring features to help them manage bulk purchases effectively could reduce waste.  
Environmentally Conscious Families: Families that are already motivated by sustainability efforts are more likely to adopt tools that help reduce their environmental footprint, including minimizing food waste.  
Co-renters with Defined Needs:    
Student Sharers: Groups of students living together often face challenges in coordinating food purchases and consumption, leading to unnecessary waste. Your app can help manage shared responsibilities and improve communication regarding food usage.  
Young Professionals in Shared Housing: Like students, young working adults sharing accommodation may struggle with similar issues around food management. Offering features that facilitate split expenses and joint shopping lists can be particularly appealing.  
Urban Co-renters: Those living in urban environments tend to shop more frequently but in smaller quantities due to limited storage space. Features that help track perishable goods can help prevent spoilage and overbuying.
